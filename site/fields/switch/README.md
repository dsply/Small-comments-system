# Installation & Update
Copy the files to `site/fields/switch/`.

# Usage
In your blueprint:

```
switchit:
  label: Switch
  type: switch
  text: You can turn me on and off
```

If you want different texts for on and off state:

```
switchit:
  label: Switch
  type: switch
  text_on: You can turn me off
  text_off: You can turn me on
```

As it is basically a single checkbox, [this documentation](http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/panel-fields/checkbox) applies.
